Who we are
This team project was done by a Jake, Edgar, Cletus and John. We are cohorts of the Summer 2019 UT Data Vizualization BootCamp.

Background
The objective of this project is to evaluate the socio-economic impact of South By Southwest (SXSW) on the city of Austin, TX.
SXSW is two-week long event focus on music, film, education and tech, that storms the city of Austin every March dating back in the 1980's. Since it's inception the event has only grown year after year. It is a great showcase of trendetters and pioneers in the tech, music, film and education sector.

:highlight Our Mission cterm=bold
While this event brings with so much opportunities to the city of Austin, it's impact is also felt with traffic, crimes, airport lines and crowds, lodging. In this project, we will analyse available data for past years to see if this event is truly the culprit of rising traffic incidents, rising airline fares, crimes and hotel prices.

Data Sources
The city of Austin Data Portal was a great resource, were we got most of our datasets. We extracted, loaded and transformed these data to suit the needs of our project. 

Tools
Our work was completed using Jupyter Notebook and we solely used Python for our programming. We used libraries such as numpy, pandas to complete this project.
