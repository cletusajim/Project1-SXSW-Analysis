## Who we are

This team project was done by a Jake, Edgar, Cletus and John. We are cohorts of the Summer 2019 UT Data Vizualization BootCamp.

## Background
* The objective of this project is to evaluate the socio-economic impact of South By Southwest (SXSW) on the city of Austin, TX. Making use of Github and it's branching system
* SXSW is two-week long event focus on music, film, education and tech, that storms the city of Austin every March dating back in the 1980's. Since it's inception the event has only grown year after year. It is a great showcase of trendetters and pioneers in the tech, music, film and education sector.



## Our Project Objective
* While this event brings with so much opportunities to the city of Austin, it's impact is also felt with traffic, crimes, airport lines and crowds, lodging. 
* In this project, we will analyse available data for 2016 - 2019 to tell if this event is truly the culprit of rising traffic incidents, rising airline fares, crimes and hotel prices.
* Our project will be managed in Github, where we will create branches, pull requests, manage merges and conflicts.
